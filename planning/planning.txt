Hi! I hope this isn't late. I had a friend have a mental health crisis after school on Tuesday. She came over and we talked and did some therapy. She's better now. 
Anyway! I tried to put my iPad notes in the gist, but they're probably illegible. 
My plan is to start on the basic HTML because I think that'll be the easiest.
Then I'm going to work on the JS until I have at least close-to-working model.
Then I will work on stylizing last.

I'm playing with a few ideas of where to store the info of what token is in what square.
My CYOA is going to be having each player select their own token!
